# Contributing to Clancy.md

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Clancy! This document explains how to contribute effectively.

## 🎯 Core Principles

Clancy is intentionally **simple and minimal**. The entire framework is one Markdown file. We're very protective of this simplicity.

**We will reject contributions that:**
- Add complexity without clear benefit
- Require dependencies or tooling
- Contradict the core 6 rules
- Add features that belong in enterprise frameworks

**We welcome contributions that:**
- Fix typos or improve clarity
- Add battle-tested learnings from real usage
- Improve examples
- Add translations (in separate files)

## 📝 How to Contribute

### Small Changes (typos, clarity)

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix/typo-in-rule-3`
3. Make your change
4. Submit a Pull Request

### Larger Changes (new sections, rules)

1. **Open an Issue first** - Discuss the change before writing code
2. Wait for approval from maintainers
3. Fork and create a branch
4. Make your changes
5. Submit a Pull Request referencing the issue

## 🔍 Pull Request Process

1. **All PRs require review** from a maintainer
2. PRs must pass any automated checks
3. Maintainers may request changes
4. Only maintainers can merge to `main`

## 📋 PR Checklist

Before submitting:

- [ ] I've read the existing CLANCY.md thoroughly
- [ ] My change maintains the "one file, zero dependencies" philosophy
- [ ] I've tested my changes with at least one AI agent
- [ ] My commit messages are clear and descriptive

## 🏢 Enterprise Features
