## What is Clancy?

Clancy is a battle-tested framework for AI-assisted development. Drop one file into your project and watch your AI coding assistant become significantly more reliable, careful, and effective.

**The Core Insight:** AI coding agents fail in predictable ways. Clancy prevents them.

## Quick Start (30 Seconds)

```bash
# Option 1: curl
curl -o CLANCY.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scainet-enterprise/clancy/main/CLANCY.md

# Option 2: Just copy CLANCY.md to your project root
```

Then tell your AI agent:
> "Read CLANCY.md before we begin"

That's it. You're protected.

## What Problems Does Clancy Solve?

| Problem | Without Clancy | With Clancy |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **AI removes features while "fixing" bugs** | Discovers after deployment 💥 | Rule 1 prevents this automatically |
| **AI claims "it works" without testing** | Manual verification every time | Rule 2 enforces verification |
| **AI uses workarounds that hide root causes** | Technical debt accumulates | Rule 5 forces proper fixes |
| **AI changes break related features** | Regression bugs | Checklist catches them |
| **Handoffs between AI sessions lose context** | Re-explain everything | Structured handover patterns |

## The Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Never Remove Functionality** - AI cannot delete features to "fix" or "improve" code
2. **Verify Before Claiming Success** - No "should work now" - must confirm with evidence
3. **Monitor All Operations** - Watch build/deploy output for failures
4. **Complete All Checklists** - Every change has a verification checklist
5. **No Workarounds** - A workaround is a symptom of an undiagnosed root cause
6. **Validate Technology Choices** - Verify frameworks/libraries exist and are current

## What's Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLANCY.md` | The framework (~2,000 lines of battle-tested wisdom) |
| `CLANCY_PROMPTS.md` | Simple phrases that guide AI behavior |
| `INCIDENT_REPORT_EXAMPLE.md` | Real case study showing why Rule 1 exists |
| `QUICK_START.md` | 5-minute setup guide |

## Clancy Prompts

Simple phrases you can say to your AI that trigger framework behaviors:

### Starting Work
```
"Hey, I'm working on [project]. Read CLANCY.md first."
```

### Before Changes
```
"What could break if we do this?"
```

### Debugging
```
"Don't fix anything yet. Just investigate and tell me what you find."
```

### Quality Check
```
"Before you call this done, verify it actually works."
```

### Ending Session
```
"Summarize what we did so the next agent can continue."
```

See [CLANCY_PROMPTS.md](CLANCY_PROMPTS.md) for the complete list.

## Why "Clancy"?

Named after a beloved character known for simple wisdom and doing the right thing when it matters. Clancy keeps things straightforward - one file, clear rules, immediate impact.

## Origin Story

Clancy was extracted from the [Agent Excellence Framework](https://scainet.io/framework) developed by SCAINET. After building 9+ AI-powered products with a solo founder + AI team, patterns emerged about how AI agents fail - and how to prevent those failures.

The enterprise version evolved into an npm package with CLI tools, automated compliance checking, and dashboard integration. But the core wisdom? That's Clancy.
